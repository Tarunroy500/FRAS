    API      | Usage
    -------- | --------
    Public   | `from frictionless import extract_table`

    Parameters:

        source (any): Source of the file; can be in various forms.
            Usually, it's a string as `<scheme>://path/to/file.<format>`.
            It also can be, for example, an array of data arrays/dictionaries.

        scheme? (str): Scheme for loading the file (file, http, ...).
            If not set, it'll be inferred from `source`.

        format? (str): File source's format (csv, xls, ...).
            If not set, it'll be inferred from `source`.

        encoding? (str): An algorithm to hash data.
            It defaults to 'md5'.

        encoding? (str): Source encoding.
            If not set, it'll be inferred from `source`.

        compression? (str): Source file compression (zip, ...).
            If not set, it'll be inferred from `source`.

        compression_path? (str): A path within the compressed file.
            It defaults to the first file in the archive.

        control? (dict|Control): File control.
            For more infromation, please check the Control documentation.

        dialect? (dict|Dialect): Table dialect.
            For more infromation, please check the Dialect documentation.

        query? (dict|Query): Table query.
            For more infromation, please check the Query documentation.

        headers? (int|int[]|[int[], str]): Either a row
            number or list of row numbers (in case of multi-line headers) to be
            considered as headers (rows start counting at 1), or a pair
            where the first element is header rows and the second the
            header joiner.  It defaults to 1.

        schema? (dict|Schema): Table schema.
            For more infromation, please check the Schema documentation.

        sync_schema? (bool): Whether to sync the schema.
            If it sets to `True` the provided schema will be mapped to
            the inferred schema. It means that, for example, you can
            provide a subset of fileds to be applied on top of the inferred
            fields or the provided schema can have different order of fields.

        patch_schema? (dict): A dictionary to be used as an inferred schema patch.
            The form of this dictionary should follow the Schema descriptor form
            except for the `fields` property which should be a mapping with the
            key named after a field name and the values being a field patch.
            For more information, please check "Extracting Data" guide.

        infer_type? (str): Enforce all the inferred types to be this type.
            For more information, please check "Describing  Data" guide.

        infer_names? (str[]): Enforce all the inferred fields to have provided names.
            For more information, please check "Describing  Data" guide.

        infer_volume? (int): The amount of rows to be extracted as a samle.
            For more information, please check "Describing  Data" guide.
            It defaults to 100

        infer_confidence? (float): A number from 0 to 1 setting the infer confidence.
            If  1 the data is guaranteed to be valid against the inferred schema.
            For more information, please check "Describing  Data" guide.
            It defaults to 0.9

        infer_missing_values? (str[]): String to be considered as missing values.
            For more information, please check "Describing  Data" guide.
            It defaults to `['']`

        onerror? (ignore|warn|raise): Define behaviour if there is an error in the
            header or rows during the reading rows process.
            It defaults to `ignore`.

        lookup? (dict): The lookup is a special object providing relational information.
            For more information, please check "Extracting  Data" guide.

        process? (func): A row processor function.
            It should be in a form of `row -> result`

        stream? (bool): Return a row streams instead of loading into memory.
            It can be useful for a big data files.

    Returns:
        Row[]: an array/stream of rows
